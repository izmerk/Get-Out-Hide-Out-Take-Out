# Get-Out-Hide-Out-Take-Out
Exploration of Gun Violence in the USA utilizing multiple datasets from different sources. Gun Violence data, Gun Laws data , School System data and U.S. Opiate Prescriptions/Overdoses are explored using python.

## Summary & Insights

### Inspiration
The title of this repository "Get-Out-Hide-Out-Take-Out" gives you an idea of the inspiration for this work. Nowadays, it is not uncommon to have to think of a plan in case of an active shooter. By taking a look at the gun violence data, it is our hope to better educate ourselves and others about common questions about this horrific incidents. 

### Which states have the most gun violence incidents?
From the Gun Violence dataset, we were able to compare all the states by adding up all the deaths and injuries for each state (for the time frame data was collected). Our findings seemed biased towards the more populated states, so we plotted these numbers on a per million people basis. The results show that when looking at the deaths and injuries on a per million basis, California, Texas, Florida, Illinois and Ohio are NO longer at the top 5 for either deaths or injuries, and shows the District of Columbia is the most violent place per both metrics, deaths and injuries per million people.

### Which locations are more prone to have a gun violence incident?
The image below was generated from the top 50 gun violence incidents locations. At first, we expected locations such as "Bar" and "Motel" to be in the top and it did not cross our minds that "Intl Airport" would be there, however data proved our intuition wrong. We were most shocked to see that "Elementary", "Middle" and "High school" show up in the top 50 as you think of these as safe places full of innocent beings.

### Do states with the higher number of restrictive laws have less gun violence?
To answer this, we estimated the number of restrictive and permissive gun laws per state from the US gun laws dataset, and plotted it next to the killed per million by state. The District of Columbia (most killed per Million People) only has 1 permissive law vs 13 restrictive laws. On the other hand, California, the state with the most restrictive laws (27 per this dataset, and only 2 permissive ones) does not rank in the bottom 25%. This could mean restrictive laws are not necessarily impacting gun violence as many expect them to.

### Is there a correlation between education quality and gun violence?
From the US school systems data, we obtained a ranking score for overall performance of states school systems, and plotted it vs the number of Killed per Million people in the state. There seems to be a correlation between them. When performance ranking > 60%, the # of people killed is less than 200 per million people in the state. This might open the debate about government focusing on education (schools) more than in correction (prisons)?

### How about drug abuse and gun violence?
The visual of gun violence incidents vs. deaths by overdose for 2014 (data readily available for that specific year) shows a linear relation. From talking to a close friend that has spent years working for DEA, this is not a surprise as illegal activities are heavily correlated especially those involving the consumption of legal and illegal drugs for "recreational" purposes.
